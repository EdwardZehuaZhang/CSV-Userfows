// PDF-Viewer.js - Main coordinator file for PDF viewer functionality
// This file serves as the entry point that orchestrates all PDF viewer functionality

// The functionality has been modularized into the following files:
// - pdf-shared.js: Shared variables and basic initialization
// - pdf-loader.js: PDF loading and URL handling
// - pdf-render.js: PDF rendering functions
// - pdf-navigation.js: Navigation controls and page management
// - pdf-view-modes.js: Toggle between page and scroll view

// All variables and functions from the modules are in the global scope
// so they can be accessed across the modules

// Because the module files are included in the HTML in the right order,
// no additional initialization is needed here.
